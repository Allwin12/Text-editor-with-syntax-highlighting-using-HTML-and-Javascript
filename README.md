# Text-editor-with-syntax-highlighting-using-HTML-and-Javascript
A simple and powerful text editor inspired from Monaco editor from microsoft. This can be embedded in a webpage to create your own online text editor for programming competitions.

This project was inspired from [Monaco editor by microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) and this [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/robertrozas/r1b9hbhk/)

Most of the css and js files required are included directly from the [github repository](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) thus reducing the size and complexity of the html file.

This project consists of only three files.
* index.html
* index.js
* samples folder
