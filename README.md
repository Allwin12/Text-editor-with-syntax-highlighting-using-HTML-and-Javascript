# Text-editor-with-syntax-highlighting-using-HTML-and-Javascript
A simple and powerful text editor inspired from Monaco editor from microsoft. This can be embedded in a webpage to create your own online text editor for programming competitions.

This project was inspired from [Monaco editor by microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) and this [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/robertrozas/r1b9hbhk/)

Most of the css and js files required are included directly from the [github repository](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) thus reducing the size and complexity of the html file.

This project consists of only three files.
* index.html
* index.js
* samples folder

The samples folder will have sample programs for all the languages that are supported by the editor. These sample programs will be loaded as soon as we select the language from the drop down box.

* abap
